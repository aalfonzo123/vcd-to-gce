vCloud Director (vCD) to Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM migrator

This is a PoC migrator, delivered as-is, no warranties, not to be used in production, not polished.

It executes the necessary steps to capture a list of VMs on vCD and create equivalent GCE VMs.

It does not require a system admin login on vCD, a regular tenant user is enough.
